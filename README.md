### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸ˜„ About me
I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Centre for Trusted Internet and Community (CTIC). My research focuses on understanding how consumers perceive trust in digital environments and how these perceptions shape their behaviors.

Before joining CTIC, I developed a deep interest in leveraging machine learning to explore psychological phenomena. This led me to pursue a Ph.D. in Data Science at the Institute of Data Science, NUS in 2020. Under the mentorship of Assistant Professor Kokil Jaidka and Professor Mike Cheung, my doctoral research examined cognitive-affective constructsâ€”such as appraisals and emotionsâ€”expressed in first-person autobiographical text and how these are perceived by other readers (third-person) in the context of consumer behavior. Grounded in psychological theories, I developed computational models of these constructs using methods from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning.

Broadly, I am passionate about two intersecting areas: using computational methods to better understand psychological phenomena expressed in text, and applying psychological principles to improve the design and capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

If you are interested in collaboratingâ€”whether itâ€™s studying psychological constructs in language, applying psychology to advance machine learning, or engaging in theory-driven psychological researchâ€”please feel free to reach out to me at gerardyeo4 [at] gmail.com.
